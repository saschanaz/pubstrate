ActivityStreams and ActivityPump experiments

A bunch of hacks on ActivityStreams / ActivityPump stuff, playing
around with things.

Everything in here is LGPL v3 or later, as published by the Free
Software Foundation, with exceptions below:

 - dustycloud_less_feed.xml is CC BY-SA 3.0

 - Some autotools related files are under the GPL v3 or later in the
   toplevel directory (their headers will say).  I guess if you
   compile things using them, maybe this project becomes GPL v3 or
   later?  I don't think so because the build tools themselves aren't
   linked, but I can't be sure.  If you really care, consider this
   whole project GPL v3 or later optionally... anyway a
   COPYING-gplv3.txt is included for these reasons.
